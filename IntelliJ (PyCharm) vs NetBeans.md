What I like about PyCharm:
* Python support

What I don't like about IntelliJ/PyCharm:
* CTRL+W doesn't close the active tab
* CTRL+F / CTRL+R shows the search box at the top. If the file doesn't have many lines (e.g. 40) it shifts all the lines down.
* Python Console doesn't use by default "Soft wraps" and doesn't show a horizontal scrollbar either, so `dir(globals)` gets out of the screen and it isn't easily visible.
